## Alpharetta

Simple app to get top 5 restaurants. Please replace `INSERT_API_KEY_HERE` in the first line of `app/restaurants.js` file with your Yelp API key before running the app.

This app uses `cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com` cors proxy as workaround for CORS headers issue with Yelp API. In a real production app, backend server will handle the API calls to the third party.

To run the app, in the project directory, run:

### `yarn start`
